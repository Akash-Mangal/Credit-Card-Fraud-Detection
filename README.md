# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This research paper presents a comparative study and analysis of credit card fraud detection using various machine learning techniques. The objective is to evaluate the performance of different algorithms in detecting fraudulent transactions and to identify the most effective approach.
Online Payments Fraud Detection Dataset" is a dataset obtained from Kaggle.
The dataset contained 6,362,620 instances.
6,354,407 instances labelled as non-fraudulent (0's).
8,213 instances labelled as fraudulent (1's).
**\nAccuracy-Graph**
The RandomForest model consistently outperformed other models, achieving the highest accuracy in all data splits except for the 80-20 split, where the Decision tree model showed the highest. While under sampling XGBoost has the best performance.
**\nPrecision-Graph**
Decision tree model consistently achieves higher precision scores across different data splits.
The XGBoost model also performs well, consistently obtaining competitive precision scores. It demonstrates a good balance between precision and recall, making it a suitable choice for classification tasks.
Undersampling lead to a loss of precision and overall performance.
