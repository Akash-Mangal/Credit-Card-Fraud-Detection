# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This research paper presents a comparative study and analysis of credit card fraud detection using various machine learning techniques. The objective is to evaluate the performance of different algorithms in detecting fraudulent transactions and to identify the most effective approach.

**Dataset**
Online Payments Fraud Detection Dataset" is a dataset obtained from Kaggle.
The dataset contained 6,362,620 instances.
6,354,407 instances labelled as non-fraudulent (0's).
8,213 instances labelled as fraudulent (1's).
In this project we have used four types of prformance metrics named, Accuracy, Precision, F1-score and MCC.

**Conclusion**
The Decision tree emerged as the top-performing model in this study.
The RandomForest and XGBoost models also showed strong performance across the evaluation metrics.
This make them viable alternatives depending on the specific requirements of the classification task.
The findings of this study highlight the importance of carefully evaluating and selecting machine learning models based on multiple performance metrics.
The Decision tree, with its consistent high performance in accuracy, MCC, F1 score, and precision, demonstrates its potential as a reliable choice for classification tasks.
